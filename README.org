** Why org-window-habit?

Standard =org-habit= tracks habits using fixed repeater intervals: complete the habit, and it reschedules for the next interval. This works well for habits with predictable schedules, but many real-world habits don't fit that model:

- *Exercise 5 times per week* - You don't care /which/ 5 days, just that you hit 5 within any 7-day window
- *Read 4 books per month* - Finishing one book per week is fine, but so is reading two books in the first week and two in the last
- *Take medication 3 times per day* - The exact hours don't matter, just the count within each 24-hour period

With standard =org-habit=, missing a single day shows as a "failure" in your consistency graph, even if you're exceeding your actual goals. This can be demoralizing and doesn't reflect how habits actually work in practice.

=org-window-habit= replaces this binary daily model with *window-based tracking*: instead of asking "did you do it today?", it asks "have you done it enough times within this time window?"

** The Window Habit Concept

A *window habit* evaluates your compliance over a rolling time window rather than a single day. You define:

1. *Window Duration* - How far back to look when counting completions (e.g., 7 days, 1 month)
2. *Repetitions Required* - How many completions are needed within that window (e.g., 5 times)
3. *Assessment Interval* - How often to re-evaluate, i.e., the step size for the rolling window (e.g., daily)

Note that window duration and assessment interval serve different purposes: the *window duration* determines how much history counts toward your goal, while the *assessment interval* determines how granularly the window rolls forward. For example, with a 7-day window and 1-day assessment interval, you get a fresh evaluation each day that looks back at the previous 7 days. If the assessment interval were also 7 days, the window would jump weekly rather than rolling daily.

A practical example where these differ: suppose you want to write 8 blog posts per month, but you don't want daily nagging - just a weekly check-in. You'd set a 1-month window duration with a 1-week assessment interval. Each week, the system evaluates whether you're on track for your monthly goal, and the habit only appears in your agenda at weekly boundaries.

The library tracks your completions and calculates a *conforming ratio* - are you on track to meet your goal? The agenda graph shows this visually, with colors indicating your conformity status (by default, green when conforming and red when falling behind).

When you complete a habit, org-window-habit automatically reschedules it to the next date when a completion will be needed to maintain conformity, rather than using a fixed repeater interval.

*** Example: Weekly Exercise

You want to exercise 5 times per week. With org-window-habit:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Exercise
SCHEDULED: <2024-01-15 Mon .+1d>
:PROPERTIES:
:STYLE: habit
:OWH_WINDOW_DURATION: 1w
:OWH_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED: 5
:END:
#+end_src

If you exercise Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you've met your goal for the week. Saturday and Sunday will show as "optional" - you don't need to exercise, but you can if you want to build buffer.

If you only exercised 3 times so far this week and it's Friday, the graph shows you're behind and the habit appears as requiring completion.

** Installation

org-window-habit is not yet on MELPA. Install from git using =straight.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-window-habit
  :demand t
  :straight
  (org-window-habit
   :repo "colonelpanic8/org-window-habit"
   :host github
   :files ("org-window-habit.el"))
  :config
  (org-window-habit-mode +1))
#+end_src

** Basic Usage

*** Creating a Window Habit

1. Create a TODO heading with =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= that has any repeater (the repeater value doesn't matter - org-window-habit uses its own rescheduling logic, but a repeater must be present)
2. Add =:STYLE: habit= under =:PROPERTIES:=
3. Add window habit properties (prefixed with =OWH_=)

*** Simple Configuration

For a single evaluation window, use these properties:

| Property                       | Description                              | Example  |
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+----------|
| =OWH_WINDOW_DURATION=          | Length of the evaluation window          | =1w=     |
| =OWH_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED=     | Target completions within the window     | =5=      |
| =OWH_OKAY_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED= | Minimum acceptable completions (optional) | =3=      |

*Weekly exercise example:*
#+begin_src org
,* TODO Workout
SCHEDULED: <2024-01-15 Mon .+1d>
:PROPERTIES:
:STYLE: habit
:OWH_WINDOW_DURATION: 1w
:OWH_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED: 5
:OWH_OKAY_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED: 3
:END:
#+end_src

This requires 5 workouts per week, with 3 being the minimum acceptable.

*Monthly reading example:*
#+begin_src org
,* TODO Read a book
SCHEDULED: <2024-01-15 Mon .+1d>
:PROPERTIES:
:STYLE: habit
:OWH_WINDOW_DURATION: 1m
:OWH_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED: 4
:END:
#+end_src

*** Advanced Configuration: Multiple Windows

For more complex requirements, use =OWH_WINDOW_SPECS= to define multiple evaluation windows. The habit must satisfy *all* windows simultaneously.

#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:OWH_WINDOW_SPECS: ((:duration (:days 4) :repetitions 1) (:duration (:days 6) :repetitions 2))
:END:
#+end_src

This requires:
- At least 1 completion in any 4-day window, AND
- At least 2 completions in any 6-day window

This prevents both long gaps and insufficient frequency.

** Configuration Properties Reference

All properties use the =OWH_= prefix by default (configurable via =org-window-habit-property-prefix=).

| Property                           | Default       | Description                                             |
|------------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| =OWH_WINDOW_DURATION=              | (required)    | Single window length (e.g., =1w=, =1m=, =(:days 7)=)    |
| =OWH_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED=         | (required)    | Target completions for simple window                    |
| =OWH_OKAY_REPETITIONS_REQUIRED=    | same as above | Minimum acceptable completions                          |
| =OWH_WINDOW_SPECS=                 | (alternative) | List of window specs for complex requirements           |
| =OWH_ASSESSMENT_INTERVAL=          | =(:days 1)=   | How often to re-evaluate (step size for rolling window) |
| =OWH_RESCHEDULE_INTERVAL=          | =(:days 1)=   | Minimum time after completion before rescheduling       |
| =OWH_MAX_REPETITIONS_PER_INTERVAL= | =1=           | Cap on completions counted per assessment interval      |
| =OWH_RESET_TIME=                   | (none)        | Timestamp to ignore completions before (fresh start)    |

** Reading the Agenda Graph

Like =org-habit=, org-window-habit displays a consistency graph in the agenda. Each character represents one assessment interval (typically one day):

- *Past intervals*: Show whether you were conforming (green) or not (red) at that time
- *Current interval*: Shows whether you need to complete today:
  - =☐= (box) - Completion needed today to stay on track
  - =✓= (checkmark) - Already completed today (or not needed)
- *Future intervals*: Project expected conformity based on current trajectory

The colors indicate your conforming ratio:
- Green shades: On track or ahead
- Red shades: Falling behind on requirements

** Customization

Key customizable variables (=M-x customize-group RET org-window-habit=):

| Variable                                         | Default     | Description                        |
|--------------------------------------------------+-------------+------------------------------------|
| =org-window-habit-property-prefix=               | ="OWH"=     | Prefix for org properties          |
| =org-window-habit-preceding-intervals=           | =21=        | Days of history shown in graph     |
| =org-window-habit-following-days=                | =4=         | Days of future projection in graph |
| =org-window-habit-conforming-color=              | ="#4d7085"= | Color for conforming intervals     |
| =org-window-habit-not-conforming-color=          | ="#d40d0d"= | Color for non-conforming intervals |
| =org-window-habit-completion-needed-today-glyph= | =?☐=       | Character for "needed today"       |
| =org-window-habit-completed-glyph=               | =?✓=        | Character for "completed"          |

** Duration Format

Window durations can be specified as:

- Shorthand strings: =1d= (1 day), =1w= (1 week), =1m= (1 month), =2w= (2 weeks)
- Property lists: =(:days 7)=, =(:weeks 1)=, =(:months 1)=, or combinations like =(:days 1 :hours 12)=
